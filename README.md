## Future Ideas

To unify repositories Back and Frontend,consider migrate to SSR framework like Next, Nuxt or maybe Angular Universal/Analog.js.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
